            <p>Among the places mentioned, the library is located on the first floor in block one, and it is regularly open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday.  The library is very quiet and silent, also this place for students and teachers to study, research and read.</p>

            <p>
              My favorite university event is Engineering and innovation. I like it because there are research proposals from invited institutions; in addition to innovations from the region. During this celebration, we have different activities for the community (students, teachers and staff keep) such as: a conference on financial culture with representatives of the Banco Agrario, offers from Innpulsa Colombia, exhibition of classroom projects and guided tour of the laboratories. The objective of the event is to encourage more ideas in the engineering branch with new projects and future endeavors.

          In conclusion, our campus is small compared to the headquarters main. But our community is very participatory in events and we feel like part of a family called university. Any student or teacher is welcome in this wonderful place.
